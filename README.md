## Hi there👋

## 🙋 About me

## 🔭 I’m currently working on

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm diving into Data Engineering and Machine Learning, learning on my own and through online platforms like [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/danielszakacsit).
I'm also studying Business Informatics at university.

Check out my Portfolio 📝, where I share my pet projects in detail!

As a hobby, I love learning languages—currently Chinese and Russian. I’ve even passed the HSK2 exam in Chinese! ⭐
