## Hi there👋

## 🙋 About me 🍙

I'm originally from Ukraine and of Hungarian descent. I'm a software developer who started my career as a sushi chef 🍣, working at Nobu London, where I honed my skills in precision, creativity, and adaptability.
However, in 2017, I boldly decided to transition into the world of software development—a field that had always intrigued me.

Since 2019, I've been working as a software engineer 💻, and over time, my passion for machine learning has only grown stronger. I love exploring new technologies, solving challenging problems, and continuously pushing my limits.

## 🚀 I’m currently working on

I’m actively working on expanding my ML/AI skills by building multiple pet projects. <!-- , which you can check out in my [portfolio](). -->

My goal is to deepen my understanding of data science, deep learning, and model deployment through hands-on experimentation and real-world problem-solving.

Beyond ML, I’ve always enjoyed working on side projects, especially Chrome extensions. In the past, I created:

- [Tab Saver - Bookmark](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tab-saver-bookmark/akoelkdffpbphokikhegnneomleldhfo?authuser=0&hl=hu) – A simple yet effective tool I built to solve my problem of managing too many open tabs.
- [Salah - Prayer Reminder](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/salah-prayer-reminder/eglgbgmahngnflijjdhghhdbflgdceif?authuser=0&hl=hu) – Initially a hobby project, but it turned out to be quite successful, now with **600+ downloads**!

## 🌱 I’m currently learning

I'm diving into Data Engineering and Machine Learning, learning on my own and through online platforms like [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/danielszakacsit).
I'm also studying Business Informatics at university.

As a hobby, I love learning languages—currently Chinese and Russian. I’ve even passed the [HSK2](https://www.chinesetest.cn/HSK) exam in Chinese! ⭐
